#Create target  groups
def create_target_group(elbv2, group_name, vpc_id, path):
    '''
    This function checks if a target group already exists in AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELBv2).
    If the target group exists, it deletes the existing one and creates a new target group. 
    If it does not exist, the function creates a new target group in the specified VPC.

    Steps:
    1. The function accepts four parameters: ELBv2 client object, the target group name, VPC ID, and the health check path.
    2. It first tries to check if a target group with the specified name exists.
    3. If the target group exists, it deletes the target group.
    4. After deleting, or if the target group does not exist, it creates a new target group.
    5. The new target group is created with an HTTP health check using the specified path and port.
    6. Finally, the function returns the ARN of the created target group.

    Parameters:
        elbv2: A Boto3 ELBv2 client object to interact with AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELBv2).
        group_name: The name of the target group to create or replace.
        vpc_id: The ID of the VPC where the target group will be created.
        path: The health check path for the target group's health monitoring.

    Returns:
        The ARN of the created target group.

    Raises:
        ClientError: If there is an issue with the ELBv2 API call, an exception will be raised.
